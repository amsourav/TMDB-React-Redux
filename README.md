# TMDB React Redux App

This app uses the latest `react-router`, `react-router-redux@next`

:sparkles: Yay SSR working
:bug: Handroll webpack config, current one very annoying


## RUN

- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

## TODO

- Clean webpack
- Figure out how to use LESS with SSR
- Read from more sources about this
- Do code splitting
- Organize the structure
